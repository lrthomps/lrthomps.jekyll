      <h1 id="books">Books</h1>

<p>I learn best from reading, not coursera-like videos (though who didn’t enjoy Andrew Ng’s course?). Papers are important to keep up with the latest, but to fill in the background usually left unexplained, the gaps that are often skipped and to expose the bits I never knew I didn’t know: I turn to textbooks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17346997-doing-data-science?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Doing Data Science</a> by Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neil: a highly readable simple introduction to most of the things that most data scientists will need</p>

<p><a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> by Michael Nielsen: back prop, loss functions, problems when we go deep</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30741739-machine-learning-yearning">Machine Learning Yearning</a> by Andrew Ng: how to train a model and ensure it works in the real world</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40363665-hands-on-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-keras-and-tensorflow">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow</a> by Aurélien Géron: it’s all in the title, great book</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/619590.Bayesian_Data_Analysis">Bayesian Data Analysis</a> by Gelman et. al: the most natural way to model a data rich world in the face of uncertainty</p>

<p><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/tree/master/">Bayesian Methods for Hackers</a> by Cam Davidson-Pilon: a shortcut to hierarchical models in tensorflow probability, the update to tf was rushed so expect mistakes</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39813875-reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement Learning</a> by Sutton and Barto: a slow building up of concepts to some of the most powerful RL algorithms and the language to understand the latest research.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> by Martin Kleppman: brilliant book not specifically about data science. Read this to understand the difficulties navigating big data.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12818088-mining-of-massive-datasets">Mining of Massive Datasets</a> by Rajaraman and Ullman: a surprising deep and thorough book on scaling algorithms to big data, covering map-reduce, stream processing, PageRank and recommenders at scale.</p>

<p>I don’t necessarily recommend <em>Deep Learning</em> by Goodfellow, Bengion and Courville: it didn’t add much to what I learned reading papers. I’m currently reading Hastie’s book <em>The Elements of Statistical Learning</em>: not sure if I recommend it broadly yet or not.</p>

<p>Beyond purely technical topics, I also suggest:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>UX for beginners</em> as a quick intro to an important role in product development that (can) interact with data scientists</li>
  <li><em>The Lean Startup</em>  for the business side of things</li>
  <li><em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em> on the damage of unacknowledged bias in models</li>
  <li><em>Gödel’s Proof</em> because it’s linked to the “No free lunch” theorem</li>
</ul>
