<h1>What We Talk About When We Talk About Flow, by David Jauss</h1>

<h2>1. THE "F" WORD</h2></h2>

<p>We all have our pet peeves. One of mine is the word <i>flow</i>. In my three decades as a creative writing teacher, I've heard it literally thousands of times. It's a rare class in which I don't hear "It flows" or "It doesn't flow" offered as an explanation of what's good or bad about a story we're discussing. What bothers me about the word&mdash;beyond the fact that I hear it so often&mdash;is that my students generally don't seem to understand what they mean by it. They intuitively recognize flowing prose when they read it, but they're not sure what constitutes it. If I ask them what makes a particular sentence or story "flow," they'll answer with semi-synonyms that are equally vague: "It's the rhythm," they'll say, or "the pace," "the style." They can't really define it.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I can't either, at least not adequately. My response to flow is undoubtedly as intuitive as theirs, for when we talk about flow we're talking about an element of writing that is more music than meaning and thus beyond rational explanation&mdash;perhaps even beyond language itself. Hence it's extremely difficult to discuss, much less define or teach.</p>

<p>Difficult, but not impossible. While there is much about the flow of prose that will inevitably remain instinctual, there are some aspects of it that can be discussed, understood, and even practiced. The principal purpose of this essay is to try to make our unconscious understanding of flow conscious, so that those of us who don't instinctively write flowing prose can practice the skills and strategies involved until they become so habitual they are, for all practical purposes, instinctive.</p>

<p>Let's begin by looking at a paragraph that&mdash;my students and I agree&mdash;flows extremely well. It's the opening paragraph of a story submitted to Ford Madox Ford in 1909, when he was editor of the <i>English Review</i>. According to Ford, the story was sent to him by a schoolteacher from Nottingham who informed him that it had been written by a young, unpublished author who was "too shy to send his work to editors." Ford didn't expect the story to amount to much, of course, but the moment he finished reading the first paragraph, he laid the story in the basket reserved for accepted manuscripts and announced to his secretary that he had discovered a literary genius&mdash;indeed, "a big one." And that night, he told his dinner companion H.G. Wells the same thing, and Wells passed the word on to people seated at a nearby table. Before the night was out, two publishers had asked Ford for first refusal rights to the young author's first book. All of this happened before the author even knew his work had been submitted to an editor, and it all resulted from a single paragraph. What was it about this paragraph that impressed Ford so much that, without reading a single word further, he accepted the story and judged its unknown author a genius? In his explanation of his decision he points out many of the paragraph's virtues, but he stresses two in particular that convinced him he could trust the author "for the rest" of the story: The author employs "the right cadence," Ford says, and "He knows how to construct a paragraph." In my opinion, cadence and paragraph construction are two of the principal things we talk about when we talk about flow. If I'm right, the paragraph's flow is a major reason&mdash;perhaps even the <i>principal</i> reason&mdash;Ford recognized genius in it.</p>

<p>Lest this turn into an essay on how to create suspense, let me say now that the then-unknown author of this paragraph is D.H. Lawrence and that it is the opening of "Odour of Chrysanthemums," his first published story. Here's the paragraph:</p>

<div class="bquote">The small locomotive engine, Number 4, came clanking, stumbling down from Selston with seven full wagons. It appeared round the corner with loud threats of speed, but the colt that it startled from among the gorse, which still flickered indistinctly in the raw afternoon, out-distanced it at a canter. A woman, walking up the railway line to Underwood, drew back into the hedge, held her basket aside, and watched the footplate of the engine advancing. The trucks thumped heavily past, one by one, with slow inevitable movement, as she stood insignificantly trapped between the jolting black wagons and the hedge; then they curved away towards the coppice where the withered oak leaves dropped noiselessly, while the birds, pulling at the scarlet hips beside the track, made off into the dusk that had already crept into the spinney. In the open, the smoke from the engine sank and cleaved to the rough grass. The fields were dreary and forsaken, and in the marshy strip that led to the whimsey, a reedy pit-pond, the fowls had already abandoned their run among the alders, to roost in the tarred fowl-house. The pit-bank loomed up beyond the pond, flames like red sores licking its ashy sides, in the afternoon's stagnant light. Just beyond rose the tapering chimneys and the clumsy black headstocks of Brinsley Colliery. The two wheels were spinning fast up against the sky, and the winding engine rapped out its little spasms. The miners were being turned up.</div>

<p>When I show this paragraph to my students, they invariably praise its flow. Even those who complain that the prose is too "descriptive" or "old-fashioned" (words that many students consider synonymous these days, alas) find the flow of this overly descriptive, old-fashioned prose to their liking. When I press them for an explanation of what makes the passage flow, however, I rarely get more than the verbal equivalent of shrugged shoulders. To help clarify for them, and me, what makes Lawrence's paragraph flow, I offer them a revision that, we all agree, does not flow. I won't subject you to the entire revision; my point should be painfully obvious after you see how I've butchered Lawrence's first two sentences.</p>

<div class="bquote">The small locomotive engine came down from Selston. It was Number 4. It clanked and stumbled. It had seven full wagons. It appeared round the corner. It made loud threats of speed. It startled a colt from among the gorse. The gorse still flickered indistinctly in the raw afternoon. The colt out-distanced the train at a canter.</div>

<p>Awful, isn't it? But why? My sentences contain the same content as Lawrence's, and that content is presented in essentially the same order, yet the passage is as stagnant as the afternoon light Lawrence describes. So clearly neither content nor order determines flow. (For further evidence, take a look at Raymond Queneau's <i>Exercises in Style</i>, in which he tells the same brief incident ninety-nine times, keeping its content and order intact and changing only the style and, therefore, the flow.) Nor does ease of reading determine flow, since the revision is significantly easier to read than the original&mdash;even a grade-schooler could follow it. So what is the essential difference between the two versions'? Nothing more, or less, than variety of sentence structure. That sentence structure is related to flow is an obvious point, no doubt, but if there's one thing I've learned as a writer and a teacher, it's that when something is obvious, we tend not to pay it sufficient attention. So let's pay closer attention to the relationship of sentence structure and flow in Lawrence's paragraph.</p>

<p>There are, of course, four basic types of sentence structure&mdash; simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex. But within these four general categories, there are many different types of structure, as the grammarian Virginia Tufte has demonstrated so superbly. In her book <i>Grammar as Style</i>, Tufte defines&mdash;and illustrates&mdash;innumerable ways to structure sentences, using left-, mid-, and right-branching modifiers, balance, repetition, coordination, inversion, apposition, and a vast array of other techniques. Significantly, Lawrence uses all four sentence types in his paragraph, not to mention many of the structural techniques Tufte describes. More importantly, seven of his ten sentences are either complex or compound-complex, the two types that permit most variation in structure. For example, both the fourth and seventh sentences are complex, but one contains five dependent clauses and the other only one.</p>

<p>Because of the variety of sentence structure in the paragraph, Lawrence's sentences range from 6 to 62 words. I use only the simple sentence pattern in my revision, however, and so my sentences range&mdash;if they can be said to "range" at all&mdash;from 4 to 9 words. According to Tufte, "The better the writer, the more he tends to vary his sentence length. And he does it as dramatically as possible." Since variation of sentence length results from varying sentence structure, ultimately it's our syntax that determines whether our prose flows or not. As Stephen Dobyns tells us, syntax is like a landscape: If it's too uniform, as in my revision, our prose will look more like Nebraska than Switzerland. A variety of sentence structure&mdash;and therefore of sentence length&mdash;will give our prose a more flowing, and appealing, landscape.</p>

<p>But because we don't think enough about syntax when we read, we don't think enough about it when we write, either. As a result, our work&mdash;my own, as well as my students'&mdash;tends to rely far too heavily on the two most basic sentence structures, the simple and compound. There's nothing inherently wrong with either, of course. In fact, the simple sentence is the base structure, the ground note of all prose. We can't, and shouldn't, do without it. But it is also the structure with the least possibility for variation in syntax and length since there are no other clauses, dependent or independent, attached to its single independent clause. The compound sentence structure is only slightly more complicated since it merely connects simple sentences with a conjunction. Because these two sentence types so dominate our writing, they prevent our prose from achieving that flowing cadence that marks the best fiction. As Robie Macauley and George Lanning have said, the simple, minimalist style "has its Spartan virtues but it also has its Spartan vices." And chief among those vices is a lack of flow.</p>

<p>Why are the simple and compound sentence types so dominant in our prose today? I asked my students and colleagues this question, and virtually everyone gave me the same answer: It all goes back, they confidently asserted, to the influence of Hemingway. But I disagree: Hemingway's simplicity is far more a matter of diction than of syntax. Like Lawrence, Hemingway knew how to vary sentence structure so his paragraphs flow. If you look at random paragraphs from his work, you'll notice how the simplicity of his diction exists within the context of complex syntax. The opening paragraph of "A Clean, Well-Lighted Place" is a good example.</p>

<div class="bquote">It was late and every one had left the caf&eacute; except an old man who sat in the shadow the leaves of the tree made against the electric light. In the daytime the street was dusty, but at night the dew settled the dust and the old man liked to sit late because he was deaf and now at night it was quiet and he felt the difference. The two waiters inside the caf&eacute; knew that the old man was a little drunk, and while he was a good client they knew that if he became too drunk he would leave without paying, so they kept watch on him.</div>

<p>The prose here is admirably straightforward and clear, but its syntax is by no means simple. All three of these sentences are compound-complex, and no two share the same structure. The number and placement of dependent and independent clauses in each varies significantly; the sentences have two, five, and three independent clauses, respectively, and one, four, and three dependent clauses. And the placement of the dependent clauses varies widely, too: The one in the first sentence <i>follows</i> an independent clause whereas three of the four in the second sentence <i>precede</i> independent clauses. And in the third sentence, two dependent clauses are embedded in the <i>middle</i> of independent clauses. Flaubert once said that "The sentences in a book must quiver like the leaves in a forest, all dissimilar in their similarity," and these sentences do exactly that.</p>

<p>I don't believe for a millisecond that Hemingway was thinking consciously about varying the placement of dependent clauses in these sentences&mdash;at least not when he first drafted them. No doubt he was responding to an instinctive sense of what would make the paragraph flow. We, too, should do our best to follow the ebb and flow of our rhythmic instincts, but to ensure that we have the skills needed to follow our instincts, we should also practice varying the structures and lengths of our sentences as rigorously as concert pianists practice scales.</p>

<p>While I don't think Hemingway can be held accountable for the current dominance of simple sentence patterns, I do think it's true that many of his followers have tended to use syntax as simple as their master's diction. This is certainly true of Raymond Carver&mdash;or, at least, of Raymond Carver as edited by Gordon Lish (as D.T. Max has revealed, Carver's hyper-minimalist style was due largely to Lish's drastic editing)&mdash;and it is also true of many of the writers who were influenced by the stories in <i>Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?</i> and <i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Love</i>. But the best of Hemingway's followers use syntax nearly as complexly. Even Carver, once he no longer allowed Lish to edit his work, varied his sentence structure and length considerably more than many of Hemingway's other disciples (not to mention Carver's own devotees). Witness the opening paragraph of "Menudo," whose four sentences use three different structures and vary in length from 4 words to 35.</p>

<div class="bquote">I can't sleep, but when I'm sure my wife Vicky is asleep, I get up and look through our bedroom window, across the street, at Oliver and Amanda's house. Oliver has been gone for three days, but his wife Amanda is awake. She can't sleep either. It's four in the morning, and there's not a sound outside&mdash;no wind no cars, no moon even&mdash;just Oliver and Amanda's place with the lights on, leaves heaped up under the front windows.</div>

<p>There's nothing wrong with simplicity, in short, if it's only apparent, not actual. The best simple writing is, at its deepest level, the level of structure, complex.</p>

<p>So if we can't blame the current tendency toward simplicity of syntax on Hemingway's example, or even on Carver's, why is it so dominant? It's not, I'm sure, because we lack the linguistic skills to write more complexly (provided, of course, that we practice those skills). And it's not, I hope and pray, because we agree with Robert Bly's ludicrous assertion that "The use of subordinate clauses in sentences reveals the writer's tendency to fascism." One reason simple syntax dominates our writing, I believe, is that such sentences are just plain easier to write. They take less effort, less thought. Plus, there's less risk of grammatical mistakes or&mdash;a worse crime in these dumbed-down times&mdash;of appearing pretentious. To some of us, it seems, writing a compound-complex sentence is about as embarrassing as wearing an ascot to a hoedown.</p>

<p>But I suspect the most important reason we overuse simple structures is that we're excessively afraid of not writing clearly. Often, in the struggle to express a complicated, only half-understood idea or emotion, we sacrifice the truth we're trying to convey in order to write simply and clearly. As Wright Morris has said, "When we give up what is vague in order to be clear, we may have given up the motive for writing." Donald Barthelme also questions the value, even the possibility, of creating art that is simple and clear. "However much the writer might long to be, in his work, simple, honest, and straightforward," he says, "these virtues are no longer available to him. He discovers that in being simple, honest, and straightforward &#8230; he speaks the speakable, whereas what we are looking for is the as-yet unspeakable, the as-yet unspoken."</p>

<p>So am I&mdash;or Morris or Barthelme&mdash;advocating the overthrow of English grammar and the production of vague, convoluted prose? Hardly. What we are advocating, however, is a conscious struggle against our natural inclination to simplify, for the sake of clarity and ease of reading, the complex, uncertain ideas and emotions that constitute our experience. And the best way to struggle against this inclination is to struggle against our tendency toward simplicity in syntax. The more we experiment with syntax, then, the more opportunities we give ourselves to discover our thoughts and express what would otherwise either remain vague or be sacrificed in the name of clarity.</p>

<p>Thus, altering our syntax does more than help us write flowing prose; it allows us to get our thoughts off the normal track on which they run. Syntax is nothing if not the very structure of our thought, so if we change the way we think, we can sometimes change <i>what</i> we think. But don't take my word for it; take Yeats's. In the introduction to his collected plays, he wrote, "As I altered my syntax I altered my intellect." Morris also believes that changing our syntax changes the way we think. According to him, "syntax shapes the mind &#8230; and does our thinking for us. If the words are rearranged, the workings of the mind are modified." And if the words are rearranged, the rhythm of those words is modified, too, of course. According to Robert Hass, it's this alteration in rhythm, more than the alteration in meaning, that changes our intellect. "New rhythms," he has said, "are new perceptions." In any case, the more we concentrate on altering our syntax, the more we free ourselves to discover other modes of thought. I'm not sure I'd go as far as Yeats, Morris, and Hass do, though, and assert that changing our syntax actually changes our intellect. Rather, I believe that as we alter our syntax, we <i>discover</i> our intellect&mdash;i.e., we find ways to say what we always knew but never knew we knew, our deepest beliefs and feelings. And it just may be that we discover not only the self but also the world. Bertrand Russell certainly believed syntax revealed the nature of outer as well as inner reality, for he concludes his <i>An Inquiry Into Meaning and Truth</i> with these words: "For my part, I believe that, partly by means of study of syntax, we can arrive at considerable knowledge concerning the structure of the world."</p>

<p>Given this relationship between syntax, thought, and discovery of both self and world, it shouldn't be so surprising that some of our greatest writers blossomed when they abandoned their native languages to write their work. As Morris says, "In this release from the overfamiliar, the apparently exhausted, and immersion into new resources, we may understand better than we did in the past the flowering of a talent like Conrad's. The new and strange language is part of a new consciousness." Nabokov is another example. He was so dissatisfied with his original Russian version of <i>Lolita</i> that he destroyed it. Only when he began to rewrite the novel in English, he says, did he find the syntax appropriate for the book, the syntax that made the book conform to what he calls "its prefigured contour and color."</p>

<p>We may not alter our own intellects when we alter our syntax, but by discovering and expressing them, we just may alter our <i>readers</i>' intellects. Indeed, it's possible that one of the things we talk about when we talk about flow is the feeling that the writer's syntax is altering our consciousness, making us think&mdash;and therefore feel&mdash;in new ways.</p>

<h2>2. SYNTAX AS SOUNDTRACK</h2>

<p>But just how does syntax do this? How can merely changing the structure of our sentences change how we think and feel? The answer is that syntax is more than mere sentence structure. As Tufte says, "Syntax has direction, not just structure," and the particular "sequence" of a sentence, its movement in time and space, generate[s] its own dynamics of feeling." Pascal made this same point in his <i>Pens&eacute;es</i>: "Words differently arranged have a different meaning, and meanings differently arranged have different effects." What alters our consciousness, then, is not so much syntax but the effects&mdash;the feelings&mdash;evoked by its sequence. As "a stylistic analysis of syntax considered as sequence," <i>Grammar as Style</i> is not your run-of-the-mill grammar textbook; rather, it is an indispensable guide to the ways writers can create different effects through different sentence structures. In the words of Lisa Biggar, it demonstrates that syntax is "a means of delay, suspense, emphasis, focus, direction&mdash;in essence, a tool to control the reader's sensory and emotional experience." One of the things we talk about when we talk about flow, then, is "the sequence of syntax" and the way it generates and controls the dynamics of the reader's emotional response.</p>

<p>Given that syntax is not just structure but a sequence&mdash;a <i>flow</i>&mdash;that generates "dynamics of feeling," it stands to reason that one purpose of syntactical variation is to convey rhythmically the emotion we wish to create in the reader. If we fail to create the appropriate rhythm, we will most likely also fail to convey fully the appropriate emotion&mdash;and that can have disastrous effects on the story as a whole. (Hence Truman Capote's comment, "A story can be wrecked by a faulty rhythm in a sentence") Whether through instinct or conscious labor (or, more likely, a combination of both), the greatest writers skillfully modulate the sequence of their syntax to modulate their readers' emotions. Lawrence is certainly one writer who had this skill; as Morris has said, in his prose "emotion and syntax seem to be of one substance." In Stuart Dybek's opinion, this skill is essentially a musical one. "There's a story," he says, "and the writer then finds the words that serve as beats and notes to capture the invisible music. And like all music, that soundless thrum, now represented in language &#8230; conveys deep emotion." As a result, he concludes, every well-written story has "its own interior soundtrack, one that a reader who listens might almost detect."</p>

<p>But sometimes the syntax does more than convey the appropriate emotion; sometimes it also rhythmically <i>imitates</i> the very experience it is describing, as when Beethoven mimics a thunderstorm in his "Pastoral Symphony" or when Duke Ellington mimics a train in his "Daybreak Express." The fourth sentence of the opening of "Odour of Chrysanthemums" is a good example of this sort of "rhythmic mimesis" in fiction. Let's take a close look at it. (To convey the sentence's rhythm, at least as I hear it, I've put the stressed syllables in capitals, and the most heavily stressed ones in bold.)</p>

<div class="bquote">The <b>TRUCKS THUMPED HEAV</b>ily <b>PAST</b>, <b>ONE</b> by <b>ONE</b>, with <b>SLOW</b> inEVitable MOVEment, as she <b>STOOD</b> lNsigNIFIcantly <b>TRAPPED</b> beTWEEN the <b>JOLT</b>ing <b>BLACK WAG</b>ons and the <b>HEDGE</b>; then they <b>CURVED</b> aWAY towards the <b>COP</b>pice where the WITHered OAK LEAVES dropped NOlSEless|y, while the <b>BIRDS</b>, PULLing at the SCARlet <b>HIPS</b> beSIDE the <b>TRACK</b>, made OFF into the <b>DUSK</b> that had alREADy <b>CREPT</b> into the SPINney.</div>

<p>Both structurally and rhythmically, this sentence divides itself into two almost equal halves, breaking at the semicolon. In the first half, the words rhythmically imitate the jolting rhythm of the passing railway cars. Seven of the first twelve syllables "thump" as heavily as the trucks&mdash;and five of those seven abut another stressed syllable, making us read the sentence's opening very slowly and thus reinforcing the sense of the train's slowness. (Imagine how different the effect would be if Lawrence had written "<b>ONE</b> after aNOTHer" instead of "<b>ONE</b> by <b>ONE</b>.") What's more, the heavy stresses evoke an oppressive mood, helping convey how the woman feels, trapped between the train and the hedge, unable to move. As the trucks fade away, however, so does the thumping rhythm: In the second half of the sentence, the stressed syllables are no longer either as heavy or as clustered, and thus the rhythm imitates the diminishing noise of the train as it gradually disappears, as well as the woman's sense of relief that she's no longer trapped. When Ford praised Lawrence's prose for having "the right cadence," I suspect he was referring at least in part to its rhythmic mimesis.</p>

<p>While I believe that rhythmic mimesis is one of the things we talk about when we talk about flow, it's important to recognize that it is not <i>synonymous</i> with flow. It results from the same impulse that creates flow&mdash;the impulse to make the sequence of syntax serve as an appropriate "soundtrack" for the story&mdash;and therefore it's a common feature of writing that flows. However, there are situations in which we can achieve rhythmic mimesis only if we avoid a flowing variety of syntax. In the following passage from <i>Light in August</i>, for example, Faulkner uses a sequence of short, choppy sentences to convey the simple, halting thought patterns of Joe Christmas, the novel's mentally challenged protagonist. There's just barely enough variety of sentence structure and length here to keep this passage from being as stagnant as my revision of Lawrence's paragraph.</p>

<div class="bquote">"Yes," Joe said. His mouth said it, told the lie. He had not intended to answer at all. He heard his mouth say the word with a kind of shocked astonishment. Then it was too late.</div>

<p>This passage is rhythmically mimetic but it doesn't flow. Nevertheless, I consider it successful. However important flow is, it is by no means the only criterion for judging the quality of our prose. As this example illustrates, there are times when flow would actually be detrimental to our fiction, if it were achieved at the expense of appropriateness. If Faulkner had tried to convey Joe Christmas's simple thoughts with the same flowing prose he uses for the maniacally intellectual thoughts of Quentin Compson in <i>The Sound and the Fury</i>, this passage would fail to convey Joe's experience and therefore to generate the appropriate response in the reader. Like flow, rhythmic mimesis is an element of good writing, not a condition of it.</p>

<p>Ezra Pound would disagree. In his essay "Vorticism," he argues that "every emotion and every phase of emotion has some &#8230; rhythm-phrase to express it," and that it is the writer's responsibility to find it. But this is an impossible ideal, for identical rhythms can, and do, convey opposite meanings. As D.W. Harding says in his study <i>Words Into Rhythm</i>,</p>

<div class="bquote">The idea that rhythms have expressive value will easily be discredited if we take it to mean that a particular rhythm is peculiarly appropriate to one emotion rather than another. 'I adore her', 'I abhor her', 'It's appalling', 'It's enthralling', all these phrases with their diverse emotional value share the same rhythmical form&#8230;</div>

<p>Harding goes on to suggest that although there are no simple one-to-one correspondences between rhythms and ideas or emotions, rhythm can "contribute appreciably" to the meaning of a sentence. In other words, while it may not be possible to make every sentence rhythmically mirror its meaning, it is possible to make some of them do so. Tufte makes this same point. Generally speaking, she says, a good sentence is one in which the rhythm and meaning are merely not "at odds with" each other. Sometimes, though, she adds, "the rhythm and sequence of syntax begin to act out the meaning itself" and "the drama of meaning and the drama of syntax coincide perfectly." This perfect coincidence of syntax and meaning, which I've been calling "rhythmic mimesis," and which Pound calls "absolute rhythm," she calls "syntactic symbolism." Whatever we call it, it is the result of the same impulse that engenders flow, the impulse to turn the sequence of syntax into a soundtrack for the story, and as such it is frequently part of what we talk about when we talk about flow. And when the rhythm of the syntax both flows and corresponds perfectly to meaning, the prose approaches poetry.</p>

<h2>3. THE MUSICAL UNCONSCIOUS</h2>

<p>And it approaches music. Ultimately, I believe, what we talk about when we talk about flow is music. As E.M. Forster says, "In music fiction is likely to find its nearest parallel." Helen Benedict seconds this opinion. "A composer would understand the analogy," she says. "Each syllable is a note, each word a bar of music, each transition from one word to the next an interval, each sentence a phrase or motif, and so on." As we've already seen, Stuart Dybek also understands this analogy, comparing as he does the rhythm of our prose to a soundtrack. Importantly, Dybek stresses that this soundtrack is not an afterthought or some kind of ornamentation but rather an essential part of the writing process itself. "One aspect of prose rhythm that is usually wholly ignored," he says, "is that a writer attentive to it, even if simply operating instinctively, often hears the rhythm before he writes the words. There is a rhythmic ebb and flow in mind that slightly precedes and certainly participates in the selection of language." Dybek is not alone in hearing the music before he discovers the words that correspond to it. Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote that his ear had long been haunted by "the echo of a new rhythm" before he finally realized that rhythm in the writing of "The Wreck of the Deutschland." And, as David Malouf notes, "Flaubert said that the last pages of <i>Madame Bovary </i>already existed as music before he had words for them." Malouf, too, often knows the rhythm of the words before he knows the words themselves and so frequently writes "a notation of long and short stresses" for the as-yet-unknown words. Alice Mattison notes further that sound, like rhythm, can also precede the selection of language: "Sometimes all I know about what I'm going to write is the sound. I know that something important happens in the story and it sounds like 'aaah.' I'll run around for days, going 'aaah'&mdash;is it a cat, is it a camera?" The philosopher Jacques Maritain has commented on these aspects of the creative process too, noting that it begins with a kind of "musical stir" in the unconscious that precedes "the production of words" and is "audible only to the heart," not the ear.</p>

<p>I've felt this sort of "musical stir" myself (though not nearly as often as I'd like), and so have most writers I've talked to. But where does this preverbal sense of rhythm come from? I suspect it comes at least in part from the language and music we grow up listening to, from the literature we've read, and even from nature&mdash;the rhythmical motion of waves, the drumming of rain on a roof, and so forth. But in recent decades, philosophers, linguists, psychoanalysts, and cognitive scientists have developed an intriguing theory that suggests an additional possible origin: They posit that we are all born with a private, innate "language of thought"&mdash;a sort of linguistic equivalent of Jung's "collective unconscious"&mdash;which we must <i>translate</i> into whatever public, learned language we speak. (What these thinkers call a "language of thought" Maritain calls the "<i>musical</i> unconscious," a spiritual, innate unconscious whose "primal expression" is the "musical stir" that precedes language.) In their view, behind our conscious language is an unconscious one, a proto-language if you will, which has its own semantics and syntax&mdash;and rhythm. And for the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, the unconscious does more than just contain a language, it is itself "structured like a language." All languages have their origin, he suggests, in the innate syntax of our collective unconscious.</p>

<p>The theorists who posit the existence of a "language of thought" believe we are wrong to believe that we think in English or any other known language. As the philosopher Jerry A. Fodor has said, "The obvious &#8230; refutation of the claim that [public, learned] languages are the medium of thought is that there are nonverbal organisms that think"&mdash;among them human children. If we need to know English in order to think, how is it that children are capable of thought before they learn the language? And how could they ever learn the language if learning requires the ability to think and thinking requires knowledge of the very language they're attempting to learn'? As Fodor asserts, "you cannot learn a language whose terms express &#8230; properties not expressed by the terms of some language you are already able to use." Therefore, like Noam Chomsky and his fellow transformational-generative linguists, Fodor argues that human beings must be preprogrammed with an innate knowledge of linguistic properties and rules that enables them to transform the syntax of thought into a public language. "[W]hat happens when a person understands a sentence," he says, "must be a translation process basically analogous to what happens when a [computer] 'understands' &#8230; a sentence in its programming language."</p>

<p>If writing is indeed the act of translating an innate, unconscious language of thought into a learned, conscious one, it makes sense that we might "hear," at least on some level, the rhythm of the former language before we translate it into the latter. And it also makes sense that this rhythm might, as Dybek suggests, "participate" in our "selection of language." Virginia Woolf certainly believed this to be the case. In a letter to Vita Sackville-West, she says, "Style is a very simple matter, it is all rhythm. Once you get that, you can't use the wrong words. &#8230; This is very profound, what rhythm is, and goes far deeper than words. A sight, an emotion, creates this wave in the mind, long before it makes words to fit it; and in writing &#8230; one has to recapture this, and set this working (which has nothing apparently to do with words) and then, as it breaks and tumbles in the mind, it makes words to fit in." The source of this rhythm that apparently has nothing to do with words is, according to Fodor, our unconscious language of thought. Robert Hass seems to agree, for he has said that "rhythm is an idiom of the unconscious." And Rilke, too, expressed a belief in the unconscious, irrational source of rhythm. In a letter to Rodin, he says, "[T]o make prose rhythmic, one must go deep into oneself and find the anonymous and multiple rhythm of the blood."</p>

<p>Whatever the source of the preverbal rhythm Woolf, Dybek, and others talk about, it is important for us to listen to it. And we should listen to the <i>post</i>verbal rhythm of our prose as well, of course. As Benedict says, if we read our prose out loud, listening attentively to its music, we will hear "that too many sentences of the same length create a monotonous beat; that forced transitions are like the wrong bridge between riffs; that overlong, breathless sentences can be the same as music without rests, those essential silences that are as important for emphasis as the notes themselves." We will hear, in short, where the prose flows, and where it doesn't.</p>

<h2>4. FORM AS RHYTHM</h2>

<p>It's important to note that when we talk about flow in prose we're not just talking about the music of a particular sentence or even passage, we're also talking about the music of the work as a whole&mdash;its entire soundtrack. The word <i>flow</i> refers not only to style, then, but also to form, to the rhythmic relationship of sentences to paragraphs, paragraphs to scenes, scenes to chapters, and chapters to an entire novel. As the jazz musician and composer Tom Harrell has said, "Form is rhythm on a larger scale."</p>

<p>In <i>Aspects of the Novel</i>, E.M. Forster discusses at length the formal relationship of a novel's parts to the whole, and he discusses this relationship in the same terms Harrell does. He says "there appears to be no literary word" for this aspect of fiction, so "we will borrow from music and call it rhythm." In Forster's view, there are two kinds of rhythm. The first kind is stylistic, the kind we recognize in the syntax of an individual sentence, and we respond to it physically. The second kind is structural, the "syntax" of the work as a whole, and we respond to it less with our bodies than with our minds. "Beethoven's Fifth Symphony," Forster says, "&#8230; starts with the rhythm 'diddidy dum,' which we can all hear and tap to. But the symphony as a whole has also a rhythm&mdash;due mainly to the relation between its movements&mdash;which some people can hear but no one can tap to." This second kind of rhythm involves the entire structure of the fiction, the way its parts flow together to form the work's soundtrack. And just as a paragraph will flow if its sentences vary in structure and length, a complete work of fiction will flow if its scenes and chapters vary in structure and length. This kind of rhythm is simultaneously cerebral and emotional, something that makes our mind and soul "tap their feet." It is this holistic, formal kind of rhythm Dybek is referring to when he says, "Hemingway talks about the need for a writer to hear his way through a story, a fact missed terribly by his many tone-deaf imitators who manage to recreate his mannerisms but miss the underlying rhythmic coherence of his best stories." <i>Underlying rhythmic coherence</i>: That's another thing we talk about when we talk about flow.</p>

<p>Like Forster and Dybek, Milan Kundera uses musical analogies to talk about the underlying rhythmic coherence of fiction. He says his novels <i>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</i> and <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i> employ "polyphonic" structure and "counterpoint." And when he talks about the rhythmic relationships of a novel's parts to its whole, he uses the term <i>tempo</i>. Like Benedict, who says tempo is as important to fiction as its content, Kundera stresses the significance of this musical element of prose. "Contrasts in tempi are enormously important to me," he says. "They often figure in my earliest idea of a novel, well before I write it." He goes on to describe the seven sections of his novel <i>Life Is Elsewhere</i> as if they were movements in a symphony. Part one, he notes, is <i>moderato</i>, since it has eleven chapters in seventy-one pages. Part seven, on the other hand, is <i>presto</i> because it has twenty-three chapters in just twenty-eight pages.</p>

<p>But the tempo of a section is not determined solely by the relation between its length and the number of chapters it contains. As Kundera says, the "tempo is further determined by the relation between the length of a part and the 'real' time of the event it describes." For this reason, he labels part six, which deals with only a few hours of actual time, as <i>adagio</i>, not <i>presto</i> or <i>prestissimo</i>, even though it has seventeen chapters in only twenty-six pages.</p>

<p>As Benedict, Dybek, Forster, and Kundera all suggest, rhythm tempo or flow&mdash;whatever we choose to call it&mdash;is essentially a holistic issue, one that addresses virtually every aspect of a work of fiction. (E.K. Brown has demonstrated that flow also manifests itself in a writer's handling of dialogue, character plot symbols and themes. I recommend you read his critical study <i>Rhythm in the Novel</i> to see how he applies Forster's term <i>rhythm</i> to these elements of fiction, which are beyond the scope of this essay.) When we talk about flow, then, we're not only talking about syntax and rhythmic mimesis but also about the tempo and structural proportion of every part of a work in relation both to each other and to the work as a whole. When we first start writing fiction, we tend to focus on the syntax of the sentence but not on the "syntax" of the paragraph. As we progress in our craft, however, we begin to think about structure in larger and larger terms. We begin to vary not only the structure and length of sentences within paragraphs but the structure and length of paragraphs within scenes and the structure and length of scenes within chapters, and so forth. And we try to make the flow of each of these parts rhythmically mimetic, or at least appropriate, to the story's events and the characters' states of mind.</p>

<p>When we begin to think about flow on a macro as well as a micro level, we realize that consecutive scenes with the same structure and length have the same monotonous rhythm, only on a larger scale, as consecutive sentences of identical structure and length. It's possible, therefore, to write a story that does not flow as a whole although its individual parts do.</p>

<p>An example: Recently, one of my most talented undergraduates turned in a story that was, sentence by sentence and paragraph by paragraph, very well written. Several of his classmates praised the flow of his prose, but a couple of them went on to say that the story as a whole didn't flow. And they were right. So we spent the rest of the class doing an analysis of its structure to try to figure out why the parts didn't work together.</p>

<p>What we found was this: The story was divided into six scenes, each of which was almost exactly two pages long&mdash;the shortest was one and three-quarters pages and the longest was two and a third pages. All six scenes covered approximately the same amount of "real" time as well&mdash;about five to ten minutes. The sameness of length made the story's rhythm seem choppy, almost staccato, and, worse, it implied that each scene was somehow of "equal" importance, when some were clearly more dramatic and life-altering than others.</p>

<p>But the equal length wasn't the only problem; indeed, it was only a symptom of a deeper problem: The reason the scenes were of relatively the same length was that they had relatively the same structure. Each scene began with a paragraph or two describing either a character or a setting or both, then followed that with several paragraphs of dialogue, then one to two paragraphs of the protagonist's thoughts, and finally one brief paragraph&mdash; sometimes, just a single sentence long&mdash;of action. While each individual scene was well written, the effect of six consecutive sections of similar structure and length was oppressive. According to Forster, rhythm requires "repetition plus variation." This student's story failed to flow because it was, structurally, repetition <i>without</i> variation.</p>

<p>While this story is obviously an extreme example, the problem it illustrates is hardly a rare one. Just as we tend to repeat certain pet sentence structures, so we tend to repeat certain pet scenic structures. We need to remember that scenes have their own kind of syntax&mdash;in a way they, too, can be simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex.</p>

<p>Let's look now at a story that varies the syntax of its scenes in such a way as to make the story as a whole flow: Tobias Wolff's "The Chain." This story consists of a chain of causally connected events, but Wolff doesn't make the mistake of making each link in the chain uniform. The story is composed of eight sections of differing lengths, structures, and tempos. The sections range in length from less than a page to nearly four pages, and the number of paragraphs per section ranges from two to forty-nine. One might suspect that the section with the fewest paragraphs is the shortest one, but in fact, that section is almost twice as long as the shortest one, and the shortest one contains more paragraphs than three that are significantly longer. And two sections of relatively equal length have eleven and forty-nine paragraphs, respectively. What Tufte said about the best writers varying sentence length dramatically also applies to the larger units of a fictional work: The best writers&mdash;and Wolff is certainly one of our best&mdash;vary the syntax of their scenes, sections, chapters, and so forth much as a composer varies the structure and tempo of a symphony's movements. And they do it for the same reason: to modulate the emotional response of the audience. For just as the sequence of syntax in a sentence "generates its own dynamics of feeling," so does the sequence of syntax in a scene, section, or chapter.</p>

<p>The first section of Wolff's story is a masterful example of how the sequence of syntax in a section generates feeling. It consists of two long paragraphs describing a man's frantic dash down a hill through deep snow to rescue his daughter from a dog that is attacking her. As the man says later in the story, "The whole thing took maybe sixty seconds. Maybe less. But it went on forever." Wolff manages to convey both the headlong speed of the events&mdash;its actual time&mdash;and the sense that it "went on forever"&mdash;its psychological time&mdash;chiefly through the way he handles the syntax of both his sentences and his paragraphs. Here's the story's opening section:</p>

<div class="bquote">Brian Gold was at the top of the hill when the dog attacked. A big black wolf-like animal attached to a chain, it came flying off a back porch and tore through its yard into the park, moving easily in spite of the deep snow, making for Gold's daughter. He waited for the chain to pull the dog up short; the dog kept coming. Gold plunged down the hill, shouting as he went. Snow and wind deadened his voice. Anna's sled was almost at the bottom of the slope. Gold had raised the hood of her parka against the needling gusts, and he knew that she could not hear him or see the dog racing toward her. He was conscious of the dog's speed and of his own dreamy progress, the weight of his gumboots, the clinging trap of crust beneath the new snow. His overcoat fiapped at his knees. He screamed one last time as the dog made its lunge, and at that moment Anna flinched away and the dog caught her shoulder instead of her face. Gold was barely halfway down the hill, arms pumping, feet sliding in the boots. He seemed to be running in place, held at a fixed, unbridgeable distance as the dog dragged Anna backwards off the sled, shaking her like a doll. Gold threw himself down the hill helplessly, then the distance vanished and he was there.<br /><br />

The sled was overturned, the snow churned up; the dog had marked this ground as its own. It still had Anna by the shoulder. Gold heard the rage boiling in its gut. He saw the tensed hindquarters and the flattened ears and the red gleam of gum under the wrinkled snout. Anna was on her back, her face bleached and blank, staring at the sky. She had never looked so small. Gold seized the chain and yanked at it, but could get no purchase in the snow. The dog only snarled more fiercely and started shaking Anna again. She didn't make a sound. He flung himself onto the dog and hooked his arm under its neck and pulled back hard. Still the dog wouldn't let go. Gold felt its heat and the profound rumble of its will. With his other hand he tried to pry the jaw loose. His gloves turned slippery with drool; he couldn't get a grip. Gold's mouth was next to the dog's ear. He said, "Let go, damn you," and then he took the ear between his teeth and bit down with everything he had. He heard a yelp and something cracked against his nose, knocking him backwards. When he pushed himself up the dog was running for home, jerking its head from side to side, scattering flecks of blood on the snow.</div>

<p>The fact that there are only two paragraphs in this section helps convey the headlong quality of the events; we pause only once in our mad dash through the deep, heavy paragraphs. The same sentences, divided into, say, six paragraphs, wouldn't have nearly the same effect. Furthermore, many of Wolff's sentences convey the same headlong hurry that the two long paragraphs do, each clause tumbling downhill after another. (He creates this "downhill" sensation chiefly by ending sentences with a cluster of dependent clauses.) But mixed into these frantic, fast-moving sentences are occasional short sentences, sentences that seem to stop the pell-mell movement of time for one brief instant much like a snapshot, thus conveying the character's sense&mdash;that he's "running in place," moving as slowly as we do in dreams. Such sentences as "Snow and wind deadened his voice," "His overcoat flapped at his knees," and "She didn't make a sound" force us to pause briefly in the midst of the frenzy. Thanks to these time-stopping sentences, the opening section accomplishes an amazing feat: It conveys both speed and slowness at once.</p>

<p>As brilliant as this section is, if Wolff had followed it with seven sections of similar structure, the story would have failed despite its superb prose and moving content. By varying the syntax of his eight sections expertly, Wolff creates the kind of rhythm that Forster talked about, the kind you can sense but can't tap your foot to: a rhythm that's simultaneously cerebral and emotional: in a word, flow.</p>

<h2>5. THE "F" WORD (REPRISE)</h2>

<p><i>Flow</i>. As I said at the outset, I'm weary of that vague, all-purpose term. But I think we're stuck with it. Though I've tried for years, I haven't been able to think of an alternative that contains all of its implications. (<i>Rhythm</i> comes close, but I think rhythm is ultimately more of a characteristic of flow than a synonym for it.) So I've concluded that the next best thing to finding a new term is trying to understand the old one better. As I hope I've made clear, I believe that when we talk about flow we're talking about the variation of sentence structure and length; about "the sequence of syntax" and its effects on the reader's emotional response; about rhythmic mimesis and the way it contributes to those effects; and about the rhythmic relation of the work's parts to the whole. Thus, if we want to write fiction that flows, we need to explore the syntax of our prose on all levels, from the micro level of the sentence to the macro level of the complete work. We need to develop our sense of a work's "underlying rhythmic coherence" by developing, first, our sense of our sentences' rhythmic coherence, then that of our paragraphs, our scenes, our sections, and so forth. The more we explore all these levels of syntax, the more we'll increase our chances of discovering both our story's content and our own intellects. And we'll also increase our chances of creating an "interior soundtrack" for our story, a silent symphony that transcends the events of the story, the denotations and connotations of the words, and moves the reader in ways as mysterious and powerful as music.</p>
